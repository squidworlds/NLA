    "This assessment is marked out of 100 and comprises 12% of the final course mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook, using this notebook as model. Your answers to theoretical questions and your discussions of results should be entered in Markdown cells. Mardown cells support basic LaTex and you should use this for formulas. (To edit a cell, double click on it; to render it, press shift+enter or run.) The rest should be code cells and their output. Your code must generate and display all relevant output when run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is **due by 4 pm on Friday November 15th 2024** (Week 9), to be submitted on Gradescope (DO NOT submit on Noteable).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow these instructions scrupulously:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To mimise the size of your notebook, do not include this preamble or the questions (you can start adding material to this notebook, then remove the preamble and questions to leave only your (numbered) answers, code and output).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When your notebook is ready, **run all the cells to make sure that the output is updated and displayed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Save a pdf version of the entire notebook. This shoud be a printable version in a single file, with individual pages (not a single long page). To obtain this, the safest way is in three steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "      - Produce a html version using nbconvert. In Noteable Jupyter Lab, this can be done by opening a terminal (under File > New Launcher, then selecting 'Terminal' on the page that opens) and, at the prompt, typing `jupyter nbconvert --to html filename.ipynb` with your file name as 'filename'. It is also possible to run nbconvert from a terminal in VS Code or using 'print preview' in the 'Classic Jupyter Notebook' of Noteable.\n",
    "      - Download the html file and open in your browser. \n",
    "      - In your browser, use 'print as pdf' or similar to save a multi-page pdf version. (In Chrome, use 'print' and set 'destination' to 'save as pdf'). Use a 'Lanscape' layout for the convenience of the markers.\n",
    " Avoid long lines of code which can get truncated in the pdf (you can write python statements over multiple lines using a backslash at the end of each line).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Submit your pdf on Gradescope** using the assignment 'Project (your pdf file)'. Please **tag your pages** with the relevant questions in Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Submit also your Jupyter .ipynb file on Gradescope** using the other assignment 'Project (Jupyter notebooks, your .ipynb files only)'. We will  mark the pdf files and use only the .pynb in case of issues with the pdf.\n",

    "### Code commenting\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should be commented, with the functionality of each non-trivial line of code explained. This is to test your understanding of the code you have written. Up to a quarter of the marks associated with the coding part of a question may be deducted for a missing, incomplete, or inaccurate code commentary.\n",
